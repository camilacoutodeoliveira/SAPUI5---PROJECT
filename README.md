# SAPUI5 Maintenance Orders – Demo Project

This is a simple SAPUI5 application created to simulate the creation and management of maintenance orders, inspired by the SAP PM module structure. It was developed as part of my personal preparation for a technical interview, aiming to revisit key concepts of SAPUI5, MVC architecture, and demonstrate practical skills.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **SAPUI5**
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js (Mock server)**
- **MVC Architecture**
- **JSON for data mocking**

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a small part of a real-world maintenance management process, focusing on:

- Creating new maintenance orders
- Listing existing orders
- Editing and deleting orders

This mimics functionalities found in real applications I have worked on, like *Mobile EAM* and *Planning & Scheduling*, which integrate with SAP PM.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Order creation form (mocked)
- List of existing maintenance orders (mocked JSON)
- Edit and delete operations
- MVC-based structure
- Usage of lifecycle hooks: `onInit`, `onBeforeRendering`, `onAfterRendering`, and `onExit`

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser
3. (Optional) Start a simple static server if needed

Since this project does not rely on a real backend, a mock JSON file is used to simulate data.
